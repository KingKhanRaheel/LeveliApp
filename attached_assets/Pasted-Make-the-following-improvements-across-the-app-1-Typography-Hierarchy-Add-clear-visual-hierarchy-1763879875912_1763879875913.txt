Make the following improvements across the app:

1. Typography Hierarchy

Add clear visual hierarchy using font weights and sizes.

Page titles should be large + bold.

Section labels medium weight.

Descriptions lighter and smaller.

Buttons should use bold text.

2. Spacing Improvements

Add more vertical spacing between unrelated elements (12–18px).

Each section should feel like a “block” with breathing room.

3. XP Bar Upgrade

Add animation when XP increases.

Consider a segmented progress style (like RPG leveling).

Add a dynamic message under the XP bar, e.g. “98 XP left to Level 2 – keep going.”

4. Streak Badge Enhancement

Animate streak increment for ~600–800ms when updated.

Add dynamic emojis based on streak length (example rules below):

Day 1 → 🔥

Day 3 → ⚔️🔥

Day 7+ → 💀🔥

5. Timer Page Improvements

During countdown, rotate motivational messages from a small preset list.

Examples:

“Brain cells activated 🧠⚡”

“No scrolling. Stay locked.”

“Future you will thank you.”

6. Session Completion Screen

After ending a timer or completing a Pomodoro cycle, show a modal with:

XP gained

Streak status

A short playful message

Add a subtle celebratory animation (pulse, glow, or particles).

7. Quick Start Button

On home screen, add a “Quick 25 min session” button above or below the main cards.

8. Feedback Animations on UI Interaction

Add micro-animations to buttons and timers (scale 1.03 tap feedback).

Apply a subtle glow pulse on hover/focus states.

9. Stats Page Meaningful Feedback

Instead of just numbers, add contextual insights.

Example messages:

“You improved 40% compared to last week. W.”

“Sunday was quiet. Fix or accept.”

10. Theme Unlock Clarity

For locked themes, show clear requirements (e.g., “Unlock at Level 5”) with better visibility.

General Tone & Branding Notes:

Tone should feel slightly sarcastic, friendly, and Gen-Z coded.

Avoid corporate language.

Keep interactions feeling fun and rewarding.

Do NOT change:

Core navigation structure

Core functionality

Existing screens

Color palette and general theme direction

Deliverables:

Updated UI components with polished layout.

Updated animations and microcopy.

Clean commit (no breaking changes).

Code comments where logic is added (XP animations, streak dynamic emojis, etc.).

When done, summarize what changed and what code files were touched.
